        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="privacy-content">
            <p>We at Suvidha Mahila Mandal respect your concerns about privacy and value the relationship we have with you.

            </ul>
            
            <h2>Email Communications</h2>
            <p>When you ask us to send you email such as a free email newsletter, you may provide us with certain information such as your email address so we can fulfill your request. You may choose to provide additional information as well, such as your postal address and phone number.</p>
            
            <h2>Donations</h2>
            <p>When you make a donation through our Site, we may ask you to submit certain personal information (such as credit card information) so we can process your donation. We also maintain your contact information in our records so we can contact you to provide ChildFund India's program information and information on additional giving opportunities.</p>
            
            <h2>Is Donation Secure?</h2>
            <p>Absolutely. The security and confidentiality of your information is our highest priority. We use industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) technology to protect your information and provide a safe and secure environment for online donations.</p>
            
            <h2>Credit / Debit Card Security</h2>
            <p>Suvidha Mahila Mandal is grateful for the donations that help us continue our valuable work. When you donate to Suvidha Mahila Mandal online, your card information is secured; your credit card number is used only for that particular transaction and is not stored. If you allow us to store your credit card or bank information for future use such as recurring donation, such information will be stored by the payment services financial institution. Suvidha Mahila Mandal only uses financial institutions that adhere to the industry standards for storing such information.</p>
            
            <h2>Disclosure Of Data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
                <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of Suvidha Mahila Mandal</li>
                <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>

                <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Security Of Data</h2>
            <p>Suvidha Mahila Mandal has the necessary security mechanisms in place and only designated employees have access to your personal information. We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction of the personal information in our possession. All online transactions are done on a secure server. When you provide credit card information to make a donation, we use the industry standard for Internet security ― Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology ― to help protect the information you provide. This Internet encryption standard scrambles data as it travels from your computer to our server. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet. You'll know that you're in a secure area of our Site when a “lock” icon appears on your screen and the “http” portion of our URL address changes to “https.” The “s” stands for “secure.”</p>
            
            <h2>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may change or update portions of this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice to you. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Policy. You may reach out to us if you have any queries about any changes made to our practices.</p>
